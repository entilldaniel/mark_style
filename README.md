# MarkStyle

Adds custom classes to generated html. For simplified use with phoenix.
This is my first library so please feel free to comment and create issues or suggest improvements. 


## Installation

mark_style isn't published to hex, and I don't know if the need for this library is
something anyone has.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mark_style, git: "https://github.com/whalenut/mark_style.git", tag: "1.1"
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/mark_style>.
